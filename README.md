# MovieLens_Personalized-Recommendation-System-Project

🔍 Problem Statement
Develop a machine learning-based recommendation engine that provides personalized content or product suggestions to users based on historical interactions, behavioral patterns, and user-item metadata.

 1.Data Collection & Preprocessing

✅ Collected dataset (e.g., MovieLens 25M, Amazon Reviews, or custom interaction logs)

✅ Cleaned and preprocessed the data:

Handled missing values

Normalized ratings

Filtered inactive users/items

✅ Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover:

User-item interaction patterns

Popularity trends

Ratings distribution

 2.Collaborative Filtering Models

✅ Implemented User-Based & Item-Based Collaborative Filtering using similarity metrics (cosine, Pearson)

✅ Trained matrix factorization models:

SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)

NMF (Non-negative Matrix Factorization)

✅ Evaluated model performance using:

RMSE, MAE

Precision@K, Recall@K

3.Content-Based & Hybrid Systems

✅ Developed a Content-Based Recommender using:

TF-IDF vectorization of item metadata (e.g., movie genres, tags)

Cosine similarity for matching items

✅ Built a Hybrid Recommendation System:

Combined collaborative and content-based outputs

Applied user feedback loop to adjust weights dynamically

4: Finalization & Reporting

✅ Compared models using visualized metrics (bar charts, line plots)

✅ Created a mock web interface/dashboard (Streamlit/Notebook):

User input

Top-N personalized recommendations

✅ Compiled a detailed final report with:

Methodologies

Evaluation summaries

Use-case applications
